# Green-Aggad
Green AGGAD is our animation course project that presents the idea of making Al-AGGAD Engineering building at Birzeit University an environment friendly building in the same way as the green cities work by reducing waste, expanding recycling, lowering emissions, increasing housing density while expanding open space with a lot of green plants around and in it. Our model will focus on featuring the whole building plus its outside space, also we are going to present one floor of the building in which we are going to clarify the ways of making the building green such as the smart windows that controls light in order to make other forms of power like heating , lighting and cooling and use light bulbs that doesn't consume a lot of electricity.Also put the recycling bins that divides the waste into paper,glass and cartoon which will help in the waste collecting process, further more we want to present that we can Benefit from the empty space around the building by making opened class rooms that will help increasing the density. And for the water crisis we live in we thought of Wells to collect rain water. As for the outside part of the building , using solar cells for the lighting poles and planting plants that lower the noise such as Cypress trees.
